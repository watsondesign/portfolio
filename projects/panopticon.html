            An immersive experience constructed around my senior capstone thesis on electronic data collection and mass surveillance. Users stepped in front of a 10-foot wide projection where their silhouette was periodically interpreted by an X-box Kinect. Vinyl
            instructions ahered to the floor instructed guests to connect to a Wi-Fi network. When a user connected, their device's name was projected over their body. A stream of live data was paired to each device and flowed to its mirrored location
            on screen. Up to 6 people could participate.
            <br>
            <br>
            It was incredibly difficult to build with only 18 days to execute. I began by learning Touchdesigner and experimenting with visuals. Then, I researched how data is sent across the Wi-Fi network: how it could be captured and stored in
            a database. Finally, I wrote a program that continuously monitored the network and sent the data to Touchdesigner when the user connected.

            /paˈnäptiˌkän/ derived from the Greek word pan, all-encompassing, and opticon, to be observed, proposed initially as a ring-shaped building with a cental watchtower where an all-seeing eye gazes upon its subjects without their knowledge. The building’s structure becomes a method of control through the fear of being watched—an invisible discipline.
            <br>
            The majority of internet users are not aware of the discrete data collection taking place. Frequencies of the wireless internet are unseen and so is the harvesting of our data. We are all subject to a panopticon in one form or another—the invisible discipline of the world wide web.
